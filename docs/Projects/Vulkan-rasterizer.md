# Vulkan rasterizer

Starting from the 2nd year I started to have in interest in graphics programming, this lead me to
search for API's to learn. Because we already learned DirectX11 in DAE I've decided to go and learn
the Vulkan API by Khronos.

For those that don't know: Vulkan is also known as the next generation of OpenGL, where the Khronos group
decided to give the developers full control of the API. This makes Vulkan very configurable but also hard to learn, hence
I've decided to start my journey and this is the result.

## The first 1000 lines

Vulkan is by far the most difficult API to get started with because it bombards the developers with loads of information. Because
of the sheer configuration possibilities it takes a LONG time to render anything to the screen. But I can say that learning Vulkan is very interesting
because it FORCES you to grasp these concepts.
