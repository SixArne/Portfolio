# Software rasterizer

## Introduction

In the 7th week of Graphics programming I we got the assignment to program a software based rasterizer with support for displaying models with textures, normal maps and shadow maps. Every week we had to expand the project with the new features.

Just like our raytracing assignment we have to optimize the code as much as possible, luckily because of my little parallel_for I managed to reach high FPS early in the project. This was the result after week 2.
