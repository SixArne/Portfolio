## About

For `Game Mechanics I` we had to make a Unity project, and we were given 2 keywords to
start generating ideas from.

The words I received were `Player Death` and `Penalty`, so after some brainstorming
I decided to make a game where the player would have to eliminate agents while the Grim Reaper
chases him down.
