# Fuji Engine

## About this project

After writing the Multi-Renderer as a school project it became clear to me that I don't fully
understand how to structure a big project and to abstract the code. A mesh shouldn't have to know
what renderer is being used to render it to the screen.

So I decided to make a game engine to learn how to structure these kind of projects better, as a reference
I will be looking at the `Kohi Game Engine` and `Hazel Game Engine`.
