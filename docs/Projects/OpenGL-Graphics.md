# OpenGL Graphics [Work in progress]

## Why OpenGL?

After learning the basics of Vulkan it was clear to me that I was still missing a lot of graphical concepts to further
enchance my skillset. So I decided to learn OpenGL as it is one of the easiest API's, I could then use
this API to learn all the different topics like e.g. Shadow mapping etc...

So this will be more of a research project than an actual portofolio piece.
