This is a game I'm actively working on in my spare time, and while I don't want to spoil any of the story details just yet, I’d like to take a moment to walk you through the mechanics that are currently in place.

The game is set in a dark environment, with the player armed only with a flashlight to navigate the space. The flashlight is a key mechanic, and to make the experience more immersive, it has a subtle "lerp" effect, causing it to lag behind the player's input just slightly. This adds a level of realism and tension, making the player feel more vulnerable in the darkness.

The player also has the ability to crouch and run, though running is limited by a stamina meter, adding an element of strategy as they decide when to conserve energy or rush through dangerous areas. Interactivity with the environment is another important feature — players can open doors in a more tactile way, either physically (by interacting with door handles) or mechanically (through switches or buttons, depending on the situation).

In addition to the core movement mechanics, there are features like flashing lights, which contribute to the atmosphere and tension of the game, keeping players on edge as they try to navigate through the dark. Soon, I’ll be adding a functional rail track system, allowing players to progress further in the game by riding a rail car, which will introduce new movement mechanics and ways to interact with the environment.

As I continue working on this project, I’m focusing on refining these mechanics and expanding the narrative elements. I’m really excited to see where it goes and how the gameplay evolves over time.
