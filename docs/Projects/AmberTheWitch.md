# Game Jam Creation: Amber the Witch

Welcome to our game jam creation, a VR game made with Unreal Engine! In this game, you play as a witch who has just moved to a new town and opened a potion shop. Your task is to fulfill customer orders by mixing and creating different potions.

However, there's a twist to this game jam creation: the theme was "fragile," so if you accidentally hit two flasks together, they will instantly break. This adds a layer of challenge to the game and requires players to be careful and precise when brewing their potions.

Despite the time constraint of the game jam lasting only 72 hours, our team was able to create a fully immersive and enjoyable VR experience. We also had the opportunity to use Perforce, a version control system, during the game jam. This allowed us to work collaboratively and efficiently, ensuring that everyone's work was integrated seamlessly into the project.

Overall, using Perforce was a great experience and allowed us to work together more effectively. We hope that players enjoy their time in our potion shop and have fun mixing and creating different potions. Thank you for checking out our game jam creation!
