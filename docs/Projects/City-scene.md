# City scene

For our 3D I Subject we had to design, model and texture a small 3D panorama scene.
I thougth for a while on what scene I wanted to make but after seeing princess Kaguya on Netflix I've decided that this was going to be my inspiration.

The story of princess Kaguya is one of the oldest folklore in Japanese mythology, I could list the entire story here but I just advice you to either read the original manuscript or watch the Netflix adoptation.

A big part of this assignment was learning how to use Maya and making textures with Photoshop. Even though I don't enjoy using Maya as much as Blender I was still happy with the end result.
