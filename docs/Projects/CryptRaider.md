# Crypt raider

Welcome to my portfolio project, a small game developed in Unreal Engine using C++. In this game, players have the opportunity to explore a dungeon and steal treasure. The game features interactive objects made with components.

As the developer of this project, I put my skills in C++ programming and game development to the test. I had to make some difficult decisions to remove textures to accommodate the file size restrictions on GitHub.

Despite these challenges, I am proud of the end result and feel that it showcases my abilities as a game developer. Thank you for taking the time to check out my project, and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed creating it.
