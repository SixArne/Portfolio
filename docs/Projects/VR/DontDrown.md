## Testerep

Five thousand years ago, the average sea level rise reached a comparable level to that at the beginning of the 20th century. The Flemish coast naturally evolved towards a dynamic equilibrium between two states, one in which the tidal influence is weak enough for a peat landscape to develop, and one in which the sea can penetrate further inland via large tidal channels.

There is little evidence for any meaningful human activity in the Flemish coastal region up to about 2,500 years ago. From the Iron Age onwards, the human presence in this coastal landscape becomes tangible. Around the same time, the tidal channel separating the Testerep peninsula from the mainland may have come into existence. This channel was connected to the river Yzer in the west and ended in a sand flat (submerged at high tide) near present-day Ostend in the east. 

## Application Development

The application was developed in Unity with a total of `4 Artists and 2 Programmers and 1 Composer`. As the application had to run standalone a lot of
time and effort was put into the optimization of set game.
