# Environments

## Introduction

In the 1st semester of the 2nd year we had another 3D related subject called environments, for this assignment we had to create an modular asset pack and make a big level in Unreal Engine 5. The end result was a full 3D level with small interactions.

## Progress

First we had to create a blockout of the level, I went through a few iterations but decided to stick with the following blockout to start with.
