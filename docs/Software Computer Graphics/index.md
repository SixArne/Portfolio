# Introduction

These days we take what our graphic cards do for granted, we ask it to open an obj file and it will magically render everything to our display, but what actually happens behind the scenes?

That's what this guide will explore, I will attempt to cover the theory of raytracing and rasterization in this guide, explaining the concepts from the ground up to hopefully shed some light on these topics.
