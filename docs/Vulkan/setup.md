# Setting up Vulkan.

This tutorial will assume you can set up your own development environment, as my main development platform is Windows
I will be using Visual Studio 2022 for these projects.

## Requirements

- LunarG SDK development kit
- Clang/GCC/MSVC
- Knowledge of C++
- GLFW
- GLM

Be sure to put GLFW, GLM and LunarG somewhere central on your system, as most projects will refer to these directories on your system
