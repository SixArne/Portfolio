Vulkan is the successor of the OpenGL API and is cross-platform and actively maintained by the Khronos group. (Creaters of OpenGL)</p><p>The main problem with OpenGL and DirectX11 was that developers didn&#39;t have full control over how the graphics pipeline functioned, now with Vulkan the developers themselves can configurate the inner workings of the graphics pipeline just like DirectX12 can. With the main difference that Vulkan is cross platform.</p>',6),o=[r];function s(c,l,d,h,u,p){return a(),t("div",null,o)}const m=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,m as default};
