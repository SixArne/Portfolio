This allows us to run older games on newer hardware and it&#39;s a way to keep the nostalgia of the old era alive. After all, the entire roots of the field I now study once started with these simple games.</p><h2 id="how-does-emulation-work" tabindex="-1">How does emulation work <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-does-emulation-work" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How does emulation work&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Every binary executable is a collection of machine instructions for the CPU, the programs we run today work in the same way, we write some simple code and that gets compiled down to instructions, typically part of an instruction set that the CPU then executes.</p><p>Emulation is writing software that can interpret these instructions in the exact same way as the original device, so to make an emulator you have to do the following things:</p><p><br><br></p><ul><li>Implement virtual components that can act just like the original hardware.</li><li>Implementing the instruction set. <br><br></li></ul><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>For the CHIP-8 The instruction set is limited, but the more modern a device is the more instructions it has, the original Gameboy had an instruction set of over 500 instructions.</p></div><h2 id="the-adventures-of-low-level-programming" tabindex="-1">The adventures of low-level programming <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-adventures-of-low-level-programming" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The adventures of low-level programming&quot;">​</a></h2><p>For this project I&#39;ve decided to use C++ and SDL, the original videos/documentation I followed were implemented using the C Language, but as my main language is C++ This seemed more straight forward.</p><h2 id="the-art-of-reading-documentation" tabindex="-1">The art of reading documentation. <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-art-of-reading-documentation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The art of reading documentation.&quot;">​</a></h2><p>As I have never used SDL myself or written anything low level this would also be the first project where I couldn&#39;t simply rely on IntelliSense to help me out.
