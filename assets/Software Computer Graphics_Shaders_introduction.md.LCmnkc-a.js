Each vertex can be defined by many different variables</p></div><p>In this stage we get the data in model space, the vertex shader then needs to output these vertices in normalised screen coordinates. This is done by applying the MVP (Model view projection) matrix on it.</p></li><li><p><b>Fragment shader</b></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>The next step is determining what fragments lie within the fragment, this is what the fragment shader will work on. This shader will in the end return a color for each fragment in the triangle.</p></div><p>This shader is being ran per pixel in the triangle, this shader is mainly used to color the geometry.</p></li><li><p><b>Geometry shader</b></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Between the vertex and the fragment shader there is an optional shader stage called the geometry shader. A geometry shader takes as input a set of vertices that form a single primitive e.g. a point or a triangle. The geometry shader can then transform these vertices as it sees fit before sending them to the next shader stage. What makes the geometry shader interesting is that it is able to convert the original primitive (set of vertices) to completely different primitives, possibly generating more vertices than were initially given.</p></div><p>This shader can be used to modify geoemtry, a good example is ocean waves.</p></li><li><p><b>Compute shader</b></p><p>This shader does nothing on the visual side, but is used for e.g. A Raytracer.</p></li></ul><h2 id="structure-of-a-shader" tabindex="-1">Structure of a shader <a class="header-anchor" href="#structure-of-a-shader" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Structure of a shader&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A shader file consists out of multiple parts</p><ul><li><p>properties, these could be <code>colors, values, textures, meshes, matrices etc... </code>.</p></li><li><p>SubShader</p><ul><li><p>Pass</p><ul><li>Vertex shader</li><li>Fragment shader</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="outro" tabindex="-1">Outro <a class="header-anchor" href="#outro" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Outro&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This guide will go over different shaders, instead of using a graphics API like Vulkan or DirectX I will be using Unity as it uses a language close to <code>hlsl</code>.
