We decided to develop a unique 2v2 rugby match set in space, where two teams battle it out: one consisting of invaders and the other of natives. The game mechanics were implemented primarily in C++, while our technical artists utilized Unreal’s Blueprints to create additional features, all based on C++ base classes for consistent functionality.</p><p>Key Features: Passing the Ball: Players can pass the ball to their teammates, and the catch is automatic unless an enemy player intercepts it.</p><p>Throwing the Ball: The ball can be thrown with a charge-up mechanic, where the player is slowed down while charging the throw, adding a layer of strategy and timing to gameplay.</p><p>Individual Abilities:</p><p>Smaller Player Variants: These players are quicker and can perform a dash move, allowing them to evade opponents more easily. Larger Player Variants: Bulkier characters can use their size to knock opponents out of the way by dashing into them, causing them to drop the ball. Bumper Pads: To prevent one team from snowballing the game, losing teams are provided with bumper pads on the side. These pads deflect incoming shots, giving the losing team a fighting chance and promoting balanced gameplay.</p><p>Gravity Fields: Gravity fields appear on the map and act as portals, pulling the ball towards them and sending it with the same velocity to the opposite side, offering opportunities for quick passes or surprise goals.</p><p>This project gave me valuable experience working on both game mechanics and collaboration within a multidisciplinary team. I had the chance to apply my skills in C++ to create complex gameplay features, while also learning from the artistic contributions of my teammates to bring the game to life.</p><h2 id="video" tabindex="-1">Video <a class="header-anchor" href="#video" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Video&quot;">​</a></h2>',10),c=e("iframe",{width:"700",height:"315",src:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/42ZEX3Y4Wow?si=tXYq7g3AlFbdnO9D",title:"YouTube video player",frameborder:"0",allow:"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share",allowfullscreen:""},null,-1),p=e("h2",{id:"itch-io",tabindex:"-1"},[s("Itch.io "),e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#itch-io","aria-label":'Permalink to "Itch.io"'},"​")],-1),h=e("p",null,[e("a",{href:"https://sixarne.itch.io/supergalaxyrugby",target:"_blank",rel:"noreferrer"},"itchio page")],-1),d=[l,c,p,h];function u(m,g,y,b,f,_){return t(),r("div",null,d)}const x=a(n,[["render",u]]);export{v as __pageData,x as default};
